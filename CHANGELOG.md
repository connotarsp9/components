# 2.0.0-alpha.0 titanium-octopus (2016-03-15)

### First release of angular2-material!

This inaugural release includes 6 components:
* [md-button](src/components/button) (buttons and anchors)
* [md-card](src/components/card)
* [md-toolbar](src/components/toolbar)
* [md-sidenav](src/components/sidenav)
* [md-checkbox](src/components/checkbox) 
* [md-progress-circle and md-spinner](src/components/progress-circle)

As the alpha process continues, these components will continue to evolve. There *will* be
breaking changes between alpha releases; the alpha releases are here for people that want an
early look or who like to live on the edge and are very tolerant of breaking API and behavior 
changes.
